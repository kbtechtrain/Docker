Ansible Setup Lab

	1. Setup Ubuntu Vm
	2. Change HostName
		$ sudo su -
		$ sudo vi /etc/hostname
		$ sudo vi /etc/hosts
		$ sudo apt-get install net-tools
		$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server

	600. This is a added line (Dummy)	600. This is a added line (Dummy)	600. This is a added line (Dummy)


	4. Add user to sudo file
		visudo
		Add line 'ansadmin ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD: ALL'  under root user [prefer this one]
		(or) - $ sudo usermod -aG sudo ansadmin 
	5. Now switch to ansadmin
		$ sudo su - ansadmin
	6. Generate ssh kays from ansadmin
		$ ssh-keygen
		Keys will stored under .ssh directory.
		$ cd .ssh
		$ ls
		id_rsa - Private kay resides in the server
		id_rsa.pub - Public key copied to Managed node
	7. Enable password based authentication (for cloud VMs)
		goto root
		sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	Find out and remove the comment hash for 'PasswordAuthetication yes' then add comment to 'PasswordAuthetication  no'
		restart the service
		$ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
	8. Install Ansible
		$ sudo su - [root]
		$ sudo apt-get update
		$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
		$ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
		$ sudo apt-get install ansible [If ansible installed properly skip to 11.]
	[While installing ansible if you get any path warning, consider add the directory to the PATH by editing the current 	profile.
		$ sudo vi /etc/profile
	and Add the line at the bottom
		export PATH="/home/ansadmin/.local/bin:$PATH"]
		$ ansible --version
	9. Download and copy ansible-config file to /etc/ansible [if you are installing ansible using pip, ansible.cfg file do 	not ceate automatically. We need to create the /etc/ansible and copy the /cfg file from Ansible official site.]
		$ sudo mkdir /etc/ansible
	Go to Ansible official website and get the config file
	url: https://gist.github.com/alivx/2a4ca3e577ead4bd38d247c258e6513b [You can browse ansible.cfg in google to get the 	latest one]
		$ sudo vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
	Paste the content of cfg file and save.
	10. Create one more file 'hosts' in the same directory where it holds all the hosts information
		touch hosts
	11. Create one or two managed nodes
		Setup Hostname
		Install net-tools
		Install openssh-server
		Create user ansadmin
		Add user to sudo file
		Enable password based Authentication (For Cloud VMs)
	12. Now add the managed node to Ansible server
		Open the /etc/ansible/hosts file in Ansible server
		Copy the ipaddress of the Managed node and paste it in hosts file.
		Copy the private key to managed node
		change to ansadmin user and run
		$ ssh-copy-id <managed node ip address>
		Now run
		$ ssh <managed node ipaddress> to connect to Managed node.
